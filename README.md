# Binary-GA-Genetic-Algorithm

The six-hump camelback problem is given as:
z = (4 - 2.1*x^2 + (x^4)/3 )*x^2 +x*y + (-4 + 4*y^2)*y^2

where x and y lie between +/-5. The objective is to minimize z. The global minimum lies at
(-0.089840, 0.712659) or (0.089840, -0.712659) where z = -1.0316285. The global optimum to the problem is given for reference purpose. Do not use it in your solution methodology.
Assume we want to solve this problem using a simple (binary) GA algorithm.
